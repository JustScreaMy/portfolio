# Hello there!

Hello there, I doubt you have ever heard of me, but I will skip the introductions, you can read them on the [main page](/).

## What is this?

This? You mean the blog? Alright, I have always wanted to have a place where I can share my progress and post my way of dealing with my developer and system administrator problems and experiences.

## What will you find here eventually?

You can expect a lot of DevOps and Linux content, sometimes maybe even programming. But you will never find anything about styling (I hate those). I'm in the progress of planning and building my own homelab, so you can expect something about Proxmox, K8S, Docker and maybe some networking too!.
