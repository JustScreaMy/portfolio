    <p>Hello! My name is Jakub Kropáček and I&apos;m from Czechia.</p>
    <p>
      I have been interested in programming since my primary school, after I saw
      a Scratch icon on my desktop in computer science class. That didn&apos;t
      last long, after few days I found out about JavaScript on Youtube. And
      that is why I chose the path I&apos;m going on right now.

        Technical School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
      </NuxtLink>
      as my secondary school, and continued to
      <NuxtLink to="https://www.fei.vsb.cz/en" target="_blank">
        VSB - Technical University of Ostrava
      </NuxtLink>
      as my college (which im still studying right now).

      I&apos;m mostly interested in Networking Technologies and Operating
      Systems but that is only a plan for a university in my future.

      What I do right now is experiment with operating systems and configure and
      deploy services. I also love learning and trying new technologies
